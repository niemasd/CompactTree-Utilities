# CompactTree-Utilities
Command line tools for processing Newick trees using CompactTree. The `ct_*` executables are intended to have usage similar to the `nw_*` executables from [Newick Utilities](https://github.com/tjunier/newick_utils) to (hopefully) enable CompactTree-Utilities to be a drop-in replacement.
